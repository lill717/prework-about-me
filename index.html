      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a new student learning coding.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Chicago, IL but moved to St. Paul, MN in 2008 for school.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>There are so many! Pretty much anything animal related like fostering and adopting out kittens through rescues, cooking good food, volunteering with kids with cancer and other serious illnesses, crafting, sewing, painting, learning violin, building things, gardening, traveling (stupid COVID-19 put a stop to that!), playing cards and board games with friends (but COVID prevented that too), crossword puzzles, visiting museums and zoos, and geocaching.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be me doing something (doesn't really matter what) that impacts the community in a positive way without sacrificing my own wellbeing. Ideally, I would make millions so I can have double impact and donate to millions of charities. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>St. Paul, MN</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>This career change was a tough decision to come to and this is not an easy question to answer. My first career did not work out and has left an enormous and negative impact on me. I need something different but still can create positive change to society without jeopardizing myself in the process. I did some soul searching and listed my skills and needs for a job. I found from COVID-19, I'm more introverted than before and need a job that's more independent. I'm exceedingly detail oriented and love puzzles. I've never worked in IT but have always been the "IT dept" at every job and at home. I'm looking at websites 10+ hours a day sometimes and thought of potentially more efficient and user friendly ways of mapping things out.  This may seem like a strange skill to have for a web developer, but I feel it benefits me more than anything: I'm very empathetic and oftentimes put myself in other peoples' shoes. I ask questions like, "If I had ----, would this website be difficult or user friendly?" I've noticed web developers are (obviously) very tech savvy, and *sometimes* forget the public is not. To the developer, the website usage may seem easy and obvious, but to those that only turn on a computer for work, the website may well have been written in Latin. And that is where I believe my empathy would be beneficial.</p>
